00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 - Hi! I'm Abby, I work for Mozilla Foundation as the Lead Developer for the Mozilla Science Lab

2
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.000
 - and today we'll be talking about Open Canvas! 

3
00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:13.000
 - Which is a tool to help you get started on you Open Source project.

4
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:17.500
 - So this is actually remixed from Lean Canvas, which is used in the startup world to

5
00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:23.200
 - make a one page business plan.
 - So we remixed this with the assumption that you'll be working with the community

6
00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:24.500
 - to build your project openly. 

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.500
 - So a lot of time in open source you are working with builders

8
00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:30.500
 - people who want to build fast and it's important to be able to step back

9
00:00:30.501 --> 00:00:34.250
 - and think about what you're doing, why you're doing it and how you'll measure success. 

10
00:00:34.251 --> 00:00:39.000
 - So the canvas, Open Canvas, is a nice lightweight to do this. It's quick to fill out

11
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:43.250
 - there's not a lot of room, so you don't have to write a tonne and it's portable


12
00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:46.250
 - you can bring it with you and easily share your ideas with others

13
00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:49.500
 - So let's take a quick look at the Canvas.

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 - So if you scroll down, here is some explanitory text.

15
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.500
 - So right away, in that problem solution key metrics, you can write down the problem you're trying to solve

16
00:00:59.501 --> 00:01:04.000
 - how you're going to solve it and what you'll measure in order to know you're succeeding. 

17
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:08.500
 - Then right underneith that in the green project execution box that helps

18
00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:14.000
 - you with your project sustainability. So as you are starting your project it's a good idea

19
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:17.500
 - to sit down and think about the kind of work that you'll need to get this done.

20
00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:22.000
 - So that way you can map this out to the contributors in the box on the right.

21
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:26.000
 - So you'll have all the kinds of contrubitors you need to get your project done.

22
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:29.750
 - and then finally, the Canvas helps you work openly.

23
00:01:29.751 --> 00:01:34.000
 - So if you're thinking about ways outsiders can become insiders, the user channel and

24
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:38.000
 - contributor channel, on the right hand side, will help you plan pathways for others to get involved.

25
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:44.000
 - So that's it! Get started! All you need to is print this off, get a pen fill it out.

26
00:01.44.001 --> 00:01:45.000
 - Enjoy!
